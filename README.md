## Project: Supervised Learning Models
## Dataset Preparation
- Collected and explored datasets relevant to the problem domains.
- Preprocessed the data by:
- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing or scaling numerical columns where required.
## Feature Engineering
- Selected key features for each supervised learning problem.
- Applied techniques like feature scaling, one-hot encoding,get-dumies, and feature interaction.
## Model Implementation
- Implemented various supervised learning algorithms, including:
- Classification Models:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost)
- Regression Models like:
- Linear Regression
## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Performed hyperparameter optimization using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to improve model performance.
## Model Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score for classification tasks.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² for regression tasks.
## Ensemble Learning
- Combined multiple models using:
- Stacking Classifier: To leverage strengths of different models.
- Voting Classifier: To improve predictions through majority voting.
## Results and Insights
- Compared performance metrics of all models to select the best-performing algorithms.
## Documentation
- Created a detailed README explaining the workflow, dataset, models, evaluation techniques, and results.
